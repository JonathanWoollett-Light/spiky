# spiky

The general idea is to support training a variety of state of the art models by assmebling state of the art techniques then running these against robotics benchmarks to answer experimental questions e.g. "are more bio-plausible models better at embodied learning?".

- Manages depdencies with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
- Generate docs with `poetry run pdoc -o docs src/spiky`.
- Format with `poetry run black .`
- We can remove all the `#type: ignore`s when `cupy` gets its shit together and adds a type stub.

### Misc

- run `snnTorch` to compare and improve until reaching similar performance for n-mnist and st-mnist.
- output the EFLOPs metrics for models to give an idea of their foundational performance.
- run a test including sparsity in the cost function
- look at [ml_genn](https://github.com/genn-team/ml_genn).
- I went to a conferece and heard about "audoAdjoint" which is intended to be a version of automatic differentiation that works for event driven models and SNNs. Look into this.
- paper from Matias Barandiaran and James Stovold on "Developmental Graph Cellular Automata Can Grow Reservoirs" and lookup info on plastic reservoirs and how these could be implemented/used.
